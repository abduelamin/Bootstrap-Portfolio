# Bootstrap-Portfolio
An upgraded version of my personal portfolio using Bootstrap 5 as the CSS framework.

## Introduction
Hello there, I'm Abdullah Elamin a newcomer to the world of front-end development. Needless to say my journey as a web developer has been nothing short of fascinating. In this project I curated a list of my personal front-end projects which all contain the necessary techniques needed to make web development effective and efficient.

I learnt many important things from building this portfolio page, the most important of all is reader engagement - Websites can be tedious to read but having one that comes to life when the user scrolls through it not only keeps the attention of the reader but it also creates a good impression of your proficiency in CSS.

In addition, I've learnt the importance of utilising a CSS framework to really take my work up to the next level. My framework of choice is Bootstrap 5 as it has an extensive library of features to use and customise.
